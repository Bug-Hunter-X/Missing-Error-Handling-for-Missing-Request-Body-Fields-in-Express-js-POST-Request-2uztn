# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for missing fields in the request body of a POST request.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js server that handles POST requests to the `/users` endpoint.  It expects a JSON payload containing user data. However, it lacks error handling for scenarios where the request body is missing required fields.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the server. It includes comprehensive error handling to check for missing fields and respond appropriately, preventing unexpected behavior or crashes.
